## Concepts
- Timenergy can be talked about ontologically using broader spans or repeatable time, but from the standpoint of a worker, timenergys pragmatic defintion puts what matters closest: the week itself.
- Even if you free up relative timenergy in your life, you lack communities of others who have it too. We need timeenergy for ourselves but we also need other people to have it because we need others to develop.

- People who're overworked want everyone else to be overworked so they can feel understood and valued through shared experiances
