# bookclub
This is a basic bookclub with a friend, works as follows (for me) 

1. Pick a book
2. Make a milestone
3. Setup issues for each chapter
4. Read the first chapter
5. Decide how many chapters we're reading per week
6. Assign chapter issues on the week they're due
7. Write notes in the books corresponding markdown file as I go
