# bookclub
This is a basic bookclub with a friend, works as follows (for me) 

1. Pick a book
2. Make an issue
3. Assign the issue when we start reading the book
4. Read the first chapter
5. Decide how many chapters we're reading per week
6. Write notes in the books corresponding markdown file as I go
