# Timenergy
![](/assets/timenergychart.png)

# Terminology
- Organic network (IRL relationships)
- Timenergy - timenergy is reliable, reusable and routinely avalible large blocks of energy-infused-time throughout the week
- Labor power - Labor is effort expended, labor power is potential labor made availible to, or put at the disposal of someoen elses interests.

# 01 - Exhaustion is the spirit of our age
##  Quotes
- "How much stress goes into trying to enjoy leisure time?"

## Concepts
- Timenergy can be talked about ontologically using broader spans or repeatable time, but from the standpoint of a worker, timenergys pragmatic defintion puts what matters closest: the week itself.
- Even if you free up relative timenergy in your life, you lack communities of others who have it too. We need timeenergy for ourselves but we also need other people to have it because we need others to develop.
- The overwhelming majority of our energy-infused blocks are sold on the auction block of the labour market. Eating and sleeping is really just recharging for work.
- People who're overworked want everyone else to be overworked so they can feel understood and valued through shared experiances

# 02 - The curse that keeps on giving
## Quotes
- "If you cannot find satisfactory fulfillment trading away the overwhelming majority of your precious time in this life to bosses, bankers and landlords then you are considered dysfunctional, a deviant, or labelled with a psychiatric disorder
	- referencing "capitalist disorders" illnesses that only display incompatability with the system
- "OCD is the only one of the more commonly known myriad conditions labeled "disorders" on the basis that the behaviour pattern interferes with ones ability to labor in a useful and routine way"
	- OCD is a terrible example of a capitalist disorder, I wonder if the author has met anyone with formally diagnosed OCD or if he's just met people with self diagnosed or the more harmful "diagnosis" where a doctor mentions in passing "it sounds like OCD", People with OCD struggle to function in foundational ways such as self maintenence. 

## Concepts
- Being gifted results in being pressured into always needing to achieve something, lesiure time is reduced to work

## Notes
- Author uses incredibly grandiose language
- Author claims timenergy is incredibly important but every thinker has come close but never quite figured it out
- Author criticizes self help but uses the same language, the same patterns and the same strategies "This is incredibly important", "I'm the only one who has the answers"
- Doesn't seem like the author has a solid grasp of mental illness or how psychology/psychiatry works

# 03 - Humanistically Qualified life VS Social Darwinism
## Concepts
- To ancient greeks slavery was not always literal you could be a slave to other peoples desires and instincts "slavish character" meaning a lack of self control
- Learning used to be a lesiure activity, now it's reduced to just a way to make more money in the labor market

# 04 - The structural stultification of timenergy
## Notes
- Grandiose language

## Quotes
- "Nothing worth doing can be done in a passive way"

## Concepts
- Without #truly# having free time you can't actualise yourself
- if free time lacks energy it's worthless time

# 05 - The American Dream: Slavery for all
## Concepts
- Bare life is spent in a state of preoccupation with basic animal concerns 

## Notes
- The parts about slavery etc felt contrarian for the sake of it
- The author claims that the only reason people disagree with them is because they don't understand

# 06 - Being-in-the-world
## Notes
- Author implies timenergy theory is not subjective
  - Does this by trying to claim a "physics" understanding of time is non-objective then word vomits a bunch to try and twist everything to justify the claim
- Felt like the author reached the conclusion then went to look for a way to justify it
- Chapter felt very bloated 

# 07 - What schooling does to timenergy
## Notes
- Incredibly bloated
- Restating how important itmenergy is YET AGAIN
# 08 - Timenergy Fragility vs Robin DiAngelo
